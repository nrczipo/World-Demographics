# World-Demographics
The purpose of this project is to utilize webscraping to obtain data pertaining to various world demographic and economic indicators, including population density, urbanization rate, fertility rate, life expectancy, GDP per Capita and oil and water consumption. Through exploratory data analysis and multivariable regression, it seeks to establish a model that can best predict a country's urbanization rate. 

The website where the data was obtained can be found at https://www.worldometers.info/

## Questions
Some of the questions answered in this project are:

  1.) What is the average population density? The median? How spread out are these values?

  2.) What is the average life expectancy? The median? How spread out are these values?

  3.) How does life expectancy for males compare and contrast with life expectancy for females.

  4.) What is the average daily oil consumption? The median? How spread out”are these values?

  5.) What is the average daily water consumption? The median? How spread out”are these values?

  6.) What is the average fertility rate? The median? How spread out are these values?

  7.) What is the average GDP per capita? The median? How spread out are these values?

  7.) Is there a correlation between any of the above variables and a country's urbanization rate?

## Project Files
This project contains two files.
World Demographics Analysis.ipynb is the Jupyter Notebook that both obtains, cleans and analyzes the data.

Countries Cleaned (1).xlsx is the excel file containing the cleaned dataset.
